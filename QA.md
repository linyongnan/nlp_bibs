## Question Answering

![](images/QA_categories.png =100x100)

We can naively categorize QA datasets/tasks with the criteria shown in the chart above, where we identify the core components of QA as question, context and answer. Different QA datasets have these components in different formats or with different features. Here we attempt to organize them and provide an incomprehensive list of papers as follows. We will include model papers later.
